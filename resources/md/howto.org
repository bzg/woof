*NOTE: Do not deploy this version as it is still a work in progress.*

* What is Woof! and how to use it?

Woof! monitors updates sent to a mailbox and exposes them on the web.
Typically, this mailbox is subscribed to a mailing list with a public
online archive so that Woof! reports can link to it.

Woof! tries to be *a good companion for free software maintainers* who
work with mailing lists by allowing them to focus on /bugs/ and /patches/.
It also aims at *making life easier for users* by pointing at important
news such as upcoming changes.

Woof! does not change the way maintainers use a mailing list for the
development of their projects: with a minimalistic set of conventions,
Woof! will extract what's important for everyone.

* Triggering a report

Woof! watches for triggers at the beginning of the subject line:

- =[ANN]= : An annoucement
- =[BUG]= : A bug report
- =[HELP]= : A help request

It also watches for patches:

- =[PATCH]= : A single patch
- =[PATCH n/m]= : A patch in a series
- A multipart mail with a =text/x-diff= or =text/x-patch= MIME part

Some triggers are special:

- =[CHANGE x]= : Announce a change in the release =x=
- =[RELEASE x]= : Announce the release =x=

The =x= part is mandatory for changes and releases and it should not
contain any whitespace.

Announcing a release =x= moves changes for =x= from the /Upcoming changes/
section to the /Latest released changes/ one.  Canceling a release moves
the changes back to the /Upcoming changes/ section.

Note that the =[...]= is case-sensitive.

* Updating a report

After a bug, patch, announcement, change, release or help request has
been monitored, replies to the original mail can trigger actions.

Actions are declared at the beginning of a line in the reply.

For *bugs*:

- =Confirmed.= : Confirm a bug.
- =Fix.= : Mark a bug as fixed.

For *patches*:

- =Approved.= : Approve a patch.
- =Applied.= : Mark a patch as applied.

For *help requests*:

- =Handled.= : Mark a request as currently handled.
- =Done.= : Mark a task of helping as done.

For bugs, patches, requests, announcements, changes and releases, you
can also cancel them:

- =Canceled=. : Mark the bug, patch, request, announcement, change or
  release as canceled.

*Note*: A punctuation mark among =;:,.= is /mandatory/ for these reports and
action words (=Confirmed=, =Approved=, etc.) are all case-sensitive.

* Notifications

Users receive a mail notification when their original reports are
detected (new bug, new request, etc.) and when these reports receive
an important update (the bug get fixed, the request get handled, etc.)

Every user can turn notifications on or off by writing to the Woof!
mailbox with this command at the beginning of a line:

- =Notifications: false= : To turn notifications off
- =Notifications: true= : To turn notifications on

* Admins and maintainers

Each Woof! instance comes with a default admin.

*Admins* can update the main configuration:

- =Maintenance: [true|false]= : Put the website in maintenance mode
- =Notifications: [true|false]= : Enable/disable mail notifications globally
- =Set theme: my_theme= : Use =my_theme= for the interface
- =[Add|Remove] admin: woof@woof.io= : Add or remove an admin
- =[Add|Remove] feature: feature= : Add or remove a feature
- =[Add|Remove] export: format= : Add or remove an export format

In these actions:

- =feature= can be =bug=, =announcement=, =request=, =change=, =release= or =mail=.
- =format= can be =rss=, =json=, =org= or =md=.

Admins can also /delete/ past reports and /ignore/ future mails:

- =[Delete|Undelete]: woof@woof.io=
- =[Ignore|Unignore]: woof@woof.io=

Remember: deletion is for cleaning up past reports, ignoring is about
future emails.  When plugging Woof! to a mailing list, first consider
moderating users instead of ignoring them.

*Maintainers* can perform these actions:

- =Add maintainer: woof@woof.io=
- =Delete: woof@woof.io=
- =Ignore: woof@woof.io=

New maintainers receive a mail notification.

Note that maintainers cannot remove admins or other maintainers and
they cannot undelete mails or unignore contributors.

Admins and maintainers can send several commands in a mail, with each
starting at the beginning of a line.  For example, an email with:

: Set theme: my_theme
: Add maintainer: my@friend.io
: Ignore: my@enemy.io

will set the theme "my_theme", add "my@friend.io" as a new maintainer
and ignore future reports by "my@enemy.io".

* Woof without a mailing list

Woof! can monitor a mailbox that is not subscribed to a public list.
In that case, the webpage exposes reports as texts with no links.  But
you can check reports by using their =json= export: it will give you the
=Message-Id= of each report, allowing to find the corresponding email.
