Woof! monitors updates sent to a mailbox and exposes them on the web.
Typically, this mailbox is subscribed to a mailing list with a public
online archive so that Woof! reports can link to it.

Woof! tries to be **a good companion for free software maintainers** who
work with mailing lists by allowing them to focus on *bugs* and *patches*.
It also aims at **making life easier for users** by pointing at important
news such as upcoming changes.

Woof! does not change the way maintainers use a mailing list for the
development of their projects: with a minimalistic set of conventions,
Woof! will extract what's important for everyone.
