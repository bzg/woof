Woof! monitors a mailbox, capture useful email interactions and expose
them on a web page.  Imagine, for example, that your email address is
subscribed to numerous free software development lists and you want to
catch bugs reports, patches, feature requests sent to all these lists:
then you can plug Woof! and have your mailbox monitored, with the most
important information exposed on a web page.

See [this howto](resources/md/howto.md) for basic instructions on how to use Woof!.


# Why Woof!?

Developing software by discussing on public mailing lists and sharing
patches by email works fine.

At some point, you may need to track bug reports, patches, etc.

If you are using [sourcehut.org](https://sourcehut.org/), perhaps you will set up a new tracker
for your project.  If your software is part of the GNU project, then
perhaps you'll set up debbugs for your package.  But these trackers
create *new communication channels*, new "databases" that you will have
to *maintain*&#x2014;and they are probably overkill for your needs.

**This is where Woof! comes in handy as a way to monitor mailing lists**.
You plug Woof! into your mailbox, it monitors emails sent to mailing
lists this mailbox is subscribed to and it extracts and exposes useful
information: bug reports, patches, changes, announcements, etc.

Woof! has been developed to help with [Emacs Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) development where
there is a mailing list with a lot of useful interactions and the need
to promote upcoming changes, bug reports, patches to review, etc.

**Woof! is not a full-fledged project management tool**: e.g. it does not
allow someone to assign tasks to someone else, to close reports, etc.


# Design rationale

-   **Read only**: Woof! is not a database of issues you need to maintain.
    Useful information is extracted from upstream email interactions,
    emails are the sole source of truth.  So Woof! is read only: there
    is no login, no way to update stuff from the website.

-   **Decentralized**: Since Woof! is based on mailboxes and only reflects
    upstream intereactions, you can have several Woof! instances for the
    same mailing lists: each instance will reflect what is of interest
    for the person who deployed it.

-   **Minimalistic conventions**: Woof! tries to rely on minimalistic and
    realistic conventions for subject prefixes (e.g. [BUG]) and updates
    "triggers" (e.g. "Confirmed.").

-   **Configurable**: Woof! tries to be highly configurable.


# Main features

-   Track various report types: bugs, patches, requests, announcements,
    blog posts, changes, releases.
-   Support tracking multiple lists
-   Expose reports as `rss`, `md`, `json` or `org`
-   Expose raw patches when possible.
-   Track related reports and allow to list them
-   Track votes on requests (e.g. `[POLL]`)
-   Allow complex searches
-   Themes
-   i18n


# Upcoming

There is no roadmap as I develop Woof! in my spare time, but here is a
list of ideas for future versions.

1.  [ ] Separate woof-server (api + webhook endpoint) from woof-web
2.  [ ] Expose data through GraphQL
3.  [ ] Better hero header search line
4.  [ ] Add pagination
5.  [ ] Add "events" as the last (?) report type
6.  [ ] Implement notifications and digests
7.  [ ] Allow to set individual notifications based on subject
8.  [ ] Complete the use of integrant (to stop)
9.  [ ] Allow webhook ?
10. [ ] Start implementing the overview page


# Setting up and running Woof!


## Requirements

You will need a mailbox accessible via IMAP that Woof! will monitor.

This mailbox must receive mails sent to the mailing lists Woof! will
monitor and must also be able to send emails.

See the environment variables in <config_example.edn> for setting
the email information.

Woof! requires Clojure and Java.

You can install clojure with `~$ apt install clojure` or see [this guide](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).

You can install Java with `~$ apt install default-jre` or refer to your
distribution instructions.


## Configure

You need to copy `config_example.edn` as `config.edn` and to set
environment variables: see <config_example.edn> for the list.

`config_example.edn` also contains other configuration parameters that
you need to set.  You can also refer to <src/bzg/config.clj> which
contains other configuration defaults.


## Test

Once you are done configuring Woof!, you can check your configuration
with:

    ~$ clj -M:test


## Run/build/deploy with deps.edn

Run with:

    ~$ clj -M:run

Build and deploy with:

    ~$ clj -M:uberdeps
    ~$ java -cp target/woof.jar clojure.main -m bzg.init


## Run/build/deploy with leiningen

Run with:

    ~$ lein run

Build and deploy with:

    ~$ lein uberjar
    ~$ java -jar target/woof.jar
