#+title: Woof! üêï

Woof! monitors updates sent to a mailing list.

Plug Woof! to a mailbox subscribed to a mailing list, and Woof! will
monitor updates about user-significant /changes/, /help requests/, /bugs/,
/patches/ and /new releases/.

Subscribers of the list can trigger Woof! by using specific words
either in the subject (for patches) or in the body (for bugs).

All updates (for bugs, patches, help requests and new releases) can be
triggered by using specific =X-Woof-*= mail headers.

See [[file:resources/md/howto.org][the howto]] for further instructions on how to use it.

* Configure

You need to set some environment variables to let the application run.

See [[file:src/bzg/config.clj]] for the list of required variables.

Run this to check your configuration:

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:test

* Run

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:run

* Deploy

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:uberdeps
: ~$ java -cp target/woof.jar clojure.main -m bzg.web

* Contribute

Woof is alpha software.  It is being tested to advertize updates from
[[https://updates.orgmode.org][Org-mode]] but you should be able to use it for any project, provided
that the maintainers on a mailing list agree to use Woof headers.

That said, contributions are welcome!
