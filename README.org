#+title: Woof! üêï

Woof! monitors updates sent to a mailbox and exposes them on the web.

Typically, this mailbox is subscribed to a mailing list with a public
archive, so that Woof! can expose links to this archive.

Woof! tries to be *a good companion for free software maintainers* who
work with mailing lists by allowing them to focus on /confirmed bugs/
and /approved patches/.

It also tries to *make life easier for users* by pointing to important
news such as upcoming changes.

Woof! tries not to impose new constraints: just continue to work on
your mailing list and with a minimalistic set of conventions, Woof!
will extract what's important for users and maintainers.

See [[file:resources/md/howto.org][the howto]] for further instructions on how to use it.

* Configure

You need to set some environment variables to let the application run.

See [[file:src/bzg/config.clj]] for the list of required variables.

Run this to check your configuration:

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:test

* Run

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:run

* Deploy

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:uberdeps
: ~$ java -cp target/woof.jar clojure.main -m bzg.web

* Contribute

Woof is alpha software.  It is being tested to advertize updates from
[[https://updates.orgmode.org][Org-mode]] but you should be able to use it for any project, provided
that the maintainers on a mailing list agree to use Woof headers.

That said, contributions are welcome!

* Support the Clojure(script) ecosystem
