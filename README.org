#+title: Woof!

Woof monitors a mailbox, stores messages in a database depending on
their headers and exposes a webpage with information on stored
messages.

Your mailbox needs to be subscribed to a mailing list and people on
the mailing list need to manually set the headers corresponding to the
events they want to store and advertize through the webpage.

* Events

Woof knows three different headers:

- X-Woof-Bug :: For declaring a bug as =confirmed= or =fixed=.

- X-Woof-Change :: For declaring that a =commit= implements a change
  that users need to be aware of in an upcoming =version=.  You can also
  cancel the change.

- X-Woof-Release :: For announcing a new released =version=.

* Usage

** Announce a release

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Release: 10.2
: ...

will declare =10.2= as a new release.

** Confirm a bug

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: confirmed
: ...

will mark a bug discussed in a thread as =confirmed=.

** Confirm a bug is fixed

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: fixed
: ...

will mark the known bug discussed in a thread as =fixed=.

** Announce a change

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: 1234567879 8.4
: ...

will declare commit =1234567879= as an upcoming change for the /future/
release version =8.4=.

** Cancel a change

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: cancel
: ...

will cancel a change that was announced in the same thread.

* Configure

You need to set some environment variables to let the application run.

See [[file:src/bzg/config.clj]] for the list of required variables.

Run this to check your configuration:

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -A:test:runner

* Deploy

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -A:uberjar
: ~$ java -jar woof.jar

* Contribute

Woof is alpha software.  It is being tested to advertize updates from
[[https://updates.orgmode.org][Org-mode]] but you should be able to use it for any project, provided
that the maintainers on a mailing list agree to use Woof headers.

That said, contributions are welcome!
