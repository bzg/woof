#+title: Woof!

Woof monitors a mailbox, stores messages in a database depending on
their headers and exposes a webpage with information on stored
messages.

Your mailbox needs to be subscribed to a mailing list and people on
the mailing list need to manually set the headers corresponding to the
events they want to store and advertize through the webpage.

* Events

Woof knows three different headers:

- X-Woof-Bug :: For declaring a bug as =confirmed= or =fixed=.

- X-Woof-Change :: For declaring that a =commit= implements a change
  that users need to be aware of in an upcoming =version=.

- X-Woof-Release :: For announcing a new released =version=.

* Usage

** Make a release

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Release: 7
: ...

will declare a release.

** Confirm a bug

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: confirmed
: ...

will mark a bug as =confirmed=.

** Fix a bug

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: fixed
: ...

will mark a bug as =fixed= if it has been confirmed before.

** Announce a change

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: 1234567879 8.4
: ...

will declare the commit =1234567879= as an upcoming change for the
future release version =8.4=.

* Configure

You need to set some environment variables to let the application run.

See [[file:src/bzg/config.clj]] for the list of required variables.

Run this to check your configuration:

: ~$ clj -A:test:runner

* Contribute

Woof is alpha software.  It is being tested to advertize updates from
[[https://updates.orgmode.org][Org-mode]] but you should be able to use it for any project, provided
that the maintainers on a mailing list agree to use Woof headers.

That said, contributions are welcome!
