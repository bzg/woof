#+title: Woof!

Woof! monitors a mailbox and tracks updates sent to this mailbox.

An update can be /a new release/, a user-significant /change/, a /bug
confirmation/ or a /help request/.

You trigger updates while sending emails with =X-Woof-*= headers.

* Usage

Managing the Woof database is entirely done by adding headers in your
replies to a mailing list.

** Woof headers

- X-Woof-Bug :: Confirm a bug.
- X-Woof-Help :: Request help.
- X-Woof-Change :: Announce a change.
- X-Woof-Release :: Announce a release.
- X-Woof-Patch :: Mark a patch as applied.

** Announce a release

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Release: 10.2
: ...

will declare =10.2= as a new release.

** Confirm a bug

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: confirmed
: ...

will mark a bug discussed in a thread as =confirmed= (see synonyms below.)

** Confirm a bugfix

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: fixed
: ...

will mark the bug discussed in a thread as =fixed= (see synonyms below.)

** Mark a patch as applied

Any email with a subject containing a substring like =[PATCH= will be
referenced as proposing a new patch.

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Patch: applied
: ...

will mark a patch as applied.

** Request help

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Help: confirmed
: ...

will add a request for help.

** Cancel a help request

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Help: canceled
: ...

will cancel the help request from within this thread.

** Announce a change

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: 1234567879 8.4
: ...

will declare commit =1234567879= as an upcoming change for the /future/
release version =8.4=.  When the =8.4= release is done, the change will
not be advertized anymore.

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: 1234567879 8.4.2 8.5
: ...

will declare commit =1234567879= as an upcoming change for the /future/
release versions =8.4= /or/ =8.5=.  If, for any reason, version =8.4.2= is not
released and version =8.5= is released instead, the change will not be
advertized anymore.

You can also omit the commit:

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: 8.4
: ...

Note that in this case, only one version is allowed.

** Cancel a change

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Change: cancel
: ...

will cancel the change that was announced within this thread.

** Annotations for bugs and help requests

By default, the summary for bugs and help requests is the subject of
the email with the =X-Woof-Bug= or =X-Woof-Help= header.

Sometimes, the subject of the email is not specific enough and you
don't want to start a subthread by changing the subject while replying
to a list.

Instead, you can simply use the =X-Woof-Bug= or =X-Woof-Help= headers to
add your summary.  For example:

: From: xxx@xxx.xx
: X-Woof-Bug: X does Y instead of doing Z, as expected.
: ...

will mark the bug discussed in a thread as =confirmed= and use ~X does Y
instead of doing Z, as expected.~ as the summary for this bug.

** Synonyms

- =confirmed=, =true=, =t=
- =canceled=, =cancel=, =closed=, =close=, =done=, =fixed=, =nil=.

* Configure

You need to set some environment variables to let the application run.

See [[file:src/bzg/config.clj]] for the list of required variables.

Run this to check your configuration:

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -A:test:runner

* Deploy

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -A:uberjar
: ~$ java -jar woof.jar

* Contribute

Woof is alpha software.  It is being tested to advertize updates from
[[https://updates.orgmode.org][Org-mode]] but you should be able to use it for any project, provided
that the maintainers on a mailing list agree to use Woof headers.

That said, contributions are welcome!
