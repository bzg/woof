#+title: üêï Woof!

Woof! monitors updates sent to a mailbox and exposes them on the web.
Typically, this mailbox is subscribed to a mailing list with a public
online archive so that Woof! reports can link to it.

Woof! tries to be *a good companion for free software maintainers* who
work with mailing lists by allowing them to focus on /bugs/ and /patches/.
It also aims at *making life easier for users* by pointing at important
news such as upcoming changes.

Woof! does not change the way maintainers use a mailing list for the
development of their projects: with a minimalistic set of conventions,
Woof! will extract what's important for everyone.

See [[file:resources/md/howto.org][the howto]] for further instructions on how to use it.

* Configure

You need to set some environment variables to let the application run.

See [[file:src/bzg/config.clj]] for the list of required variables.

Run this to check your configuration:

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:test

* Run

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:run

* Deploy

: ~$ cd woof/
: ~$ clj -M:uberdeps
: ~$ java -cp target/woof.jar clojure.main -m bzg.web

* Contribute

Woof is alpha software.  It is being tested to advertize updates from
[[https://updates.orgmode.org][Org-mode]] but you should be able to use it for any project, provided
that the maintainers on a mailing list agree to use Woof headers.

That said, contributions are welcome!

* Support the Clojure(script) ecosystem
